2 Programs and Reflection
The programs are written in Java Language.
One program called forecast.java that converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius and back. Output of program is also attached as forcast.txt file. Description is also written in the program and comments for functions are in the program too.
Second program is called Sorting.java that reads a file with names and position numbers that is out of order and rearanges it by the position number back into proper order. Uses bubble sort, and arrays. Description is in the Sorting program also with comments.
The third program i couldnt do because i never lerned how to make requests to API and do not know what it is. I have not learned it in our class or any prior class I took to be able to do it so I'm really hoping i don't lose points for something i was never thought how to do. I tried searching online and found some directions and even complete code for the exact thing asked in the assignment online. I tried doing some reaserch but couldnt figure it out on my own how it works and couldnt even run it to see that it does what is stated and i obviously didnt want to post someone elses code since that would be terribly wrong and i didnt even learn anything from it. Maybe if there was more time i would try to do more reasearch on the subject or if we can cover it in class it would be great also.
